# Runtime Command Registry

**Canonical path:** `docs/environment/commands.md`

This registry contains implemented commands and planned outputs, distinguished in the table below. Each command-creating task populates exact spellings/arguments/script paths and verifies safe behavior; a planned row is not proof of implementation. The normal front door is root Makefile, unless PD-02 explicitly approves an equivalent and records actual mappings. Root README/CONTRIBUTING/CI must match this registry after PRE-00.

For EACH command record: creator task, exact invocation and required inputs, supported shell/runtime, target/environment, effects and destructive/billable behavior, prerequisite milestone, expected output/exit status, failure/recovery, tests/evidence. Commands must reject unspecified or wrong targets rather than guessing an AWS account/region/database.

| Required command outcome | Creator | Current state |

| Install/setup | PD-02/04/07/13 | Web: root `npm ci` implemented in PD-07 Step 1; combined setup remains pending PD-13; see each creator's accepted implementation |
| Local start/stop/readiness | PD-05/07/08/13 | Web dev/preview start and foreground stop implemented in PD-07 Step 1; combined lifecycle remains pending PD-13 |

| Terraform static format/validate (no remote state mutation) | PD-15 | Not implemented |
| Plan/apply/build-release/deploy/verify/rollback/teardown | PD-15/16; domain/EXP additions | Not implemented; gated actions separate from local/CI check |
| Search evaluator/load workload/NFR manifests | SE-01 | Not implemented |

An absent command assigned to the selected creation step is an expected output; the agent creates/registers/tests it. An absent prerequisite or uncertain expected effect blocks the dependent action and requires a question. No cloud operation belongs in the generic local/CI aggregate target.

## PD-07 Step 1 — local web bootstrap

Run these commands from the repository root with Node.js 24 LTS and npm 11 on
PATH. The first verified runtime is Node 24.22.0/npm 11.19.1. These commands use
the one root Node manifest and lockfile; they do not invoke the root Makefile.
PD-13 integrates the common front door later. See
[web instructions](../../apps/web/README.md) and the
[build-tool decision](../decisions/web-build-tooling.md).

| Exact command | Inputs and effects | Success | Failure and recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npm ci` | Requires the Step 1 manifest/lockfile and public npm-registry access; replaces this checkout's generated `node_modules/` and uses the contributor's npm cache. No cloud resources or private application data. | Exit 0; dependencies match the lockfile. | Resolve runtime/network or manifest/lock mismatch; do not hide it with unrelated upgrades or a second lockfile. |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the foreground Vite process on `127.0.0.1:5173`; may write generated dependency-cache files inside ignored `node_modules/`. No application API calls/providers are configured. | Vite reports the exact loopback URL and serves the technical HTML/TSX mount point. | An occupied port fails instead of silently moving. Inspect the owned process; do not terminate an unrelated service. Stop this foreground process with Ctrl+C. |
| `npm run build` | Type-checks the app and test/config TypeScript, then bundles into ignored `apps/web/dist/`, replacing that generated output. | Exit 0 from both TypeScript and Vite, with built assets. | Preserve the error and fix the owned source/configuration; a failed check is not deployment evidence. |
| `npm run preview` | Requires the completed local build; starts a foreground loopback server on `127.0.0.1:4173` to inspect `apps/web/dist/`. | Exact preview URL serves the built HTML/assets. | Build first if output is missing; investigate occupied ports. Stop with Ctrl+C. This command does not deploy. |

Each command is local and requires no AWS credentials, database, account, or
production endpoint. The development/preview processes do not detach or create
a persistent service. An unwritable npm cache can be redirected to a writable
contributor-local location with `NPM_CONFIG_CACHE`; do not change credentials or
use a privileged install merely to write the cache. Step 1 checks install,
build, bootstrap rendering, and HTTP start/stop. Step 8 records full scaffold
acceptance after running the registered checks against the implemented routes.

## PD-07 Step 7 — web lint, type, test, build, and aggregate checks

Run from the repository root with Node.js 24 LTS and npm 11. Tool versions are
exactly pinned in the root manifest/lockfile. These commands are local; none
reads cloud credentials, contacts a production endpoint, or requires an
external account. `npm run dev` and `npm run preview` remain foreground,
loopback-only processes stopped with Ctrl+C.

| Exact command | Inputs and effects | Success | Failure and recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | Runs the pinned Biome linter on `apps/web/src/`, `apps/web/tests/`, and the Vite/Vitest configs using `apps/web/biome.json`. Does not rewrite files. | Exit 0 with no lint findings. | Read the reported file/rule, correct the owned code or discuss a rule change; do not suppress unrelated findings. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Runs TypeScript with the app config, then with `apps/web/tests/tsconfig.json` for tests and Vite/Vitest configs. Both configs have `noEmit`; no generated JavaScript is written. | Exit 0 for both projects. | Fix the reported type/config issue, then rerun the command. |
| `npm test` | Runs Vitest once using `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`. It checks the actual route configuration against the approved paths and matches representative static/dynamic/unknown URLs. It also parses source imports to enforce public feature entry points for pages and prevent private cross-domain imports. It does not assert placeholder labels or `.gitkeep` files. | Exit 0 with architecture tests passing. | Use the failing route or import report to fix the route tree/boundary; update expected paths only after an approved route change. |
| `npm run build` | Runs the app/test TypeScript checks, then Vite production bundling into ignored `apps/web/dist/`, replacing generated output. | Exit 0 with built assets. | Resolve TypeScript or bundler errors. Build output is local and is not deployed. |
| `npm run check` | Runs lint, Vitest architecture tests, and production build in sequence; the build includes both TypeScript checks. May replace local ignored `apps/web/dist/`. | Exit 0 only when all checks pass. | Fix the first failing command and rerun the aggregate command. |

The route test's approved-path list is a product-structure assertion and changes
only after a route is approved. It deliberately avoids assertions tied to
placeholder wording/appearance. Page composition connections and the continuing
handoff markers are reviewed during PD-07 Step 8; there is no marker-presence
automated test. PD-12 later wires the agreed web checks into CI, and PD-13 later
adds them to the shared repository command front door.

## Workstation and stub command registration

The setup guide contains one-time agent-access/clone commands, not implemented application targets. BOOT-00 records actual Linux paths/agent availability; PD-02/13 freeze the verified development toolchain and application commands. PD-10/DL-00/domain owners register explicit test-double scenarios and real integration commands with distinct names/modes. No deployed command may default to fake auth/storage/notification/domain providers; startup validation rejects them. Stub tests never share a label or result classification with cloud/NFR runs.
