# Runtime Command Registry

**Canonical path:** `docs/environment/commands.md`

This registry contains implemented commands and planned outputs, distinguished in the table below. Each command-creating task populates exact spellings/arguments/script paths and verifies safe behavior; a planned row is not proof of implementation. The normal front door is root Makefile, unless PD-02 explicitly approves an equivalent and records actual mappings. Root README/CONTRIBUTING/CI must match this registry after PRE-00.

For EACH command record: creator task, exact invocation and required inputs, supported shell/runtime, target/environment, effects and destructive/billable behavior, prerequisite milestone, expected output/exit status, failure/recovery, tests/evidence. Commands must reject unspecified or wrong targets rather than guessing an AWS account/region/database.

| Required command outcome | Creator | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| Install/setup | PD-02/04/07/13 | Python tools: `uv sync --locked` implemented/verified in PD-04; web and combined setup remain pending PD-07/13 |
| Local start/stop/readiness | PD-05/07/08/13 | API process start/stop/health and typed settings human-verified at PD-05 steps 1–2; web/database/combined lifecycle remain future outputs |
| Local migration/status/reset and small seed | PD-08/13 | Not implemented; reset local-only and explicit |
| Generator framework/tests | PD-09 | Not implemented |
| Final reference generate/load/validate/fingerprint | SE-01/DATA-READY | Not implemented; requires domain schemas/configuration |
| Python format and non-mutating pinned Black check | PD-04 | Implemented and human-verified at step 3; exact commands and verification below |
| Test/lint/type/build/aggregate CI-equivalent | PD-05/07/12/13 | API/configuration suite implemented and human-verified at PD-05 step 5; web/CI/aggregate commands remain future outputs |
| Contract regenerate/stale-check | PD-11/DL-00 | Not implemented |
| Terraform static format/validate (no remote state mutation) | PD-15 | Not implemented |
| Plan/apply/build-release/deploy/verify/rollback/teardown | PD-15/16; domain/EXP additions | Not implemented; gated actions separate from local/CI check |
| Search evaluator/load workload/NFR manifests | SE-01 | Not implemented |
| Two-client chat/read-state/latency measurement | CN-01/CN-03 | Not implemented |
| Integrated peak/runtime-loss/DB-restore checks | INT-01 | Not implemented |
| Mixed Lambda package/routing/parity/deploy/workloads/analysis | EXP-02/03–08 | Not implemented |
| Final regression/export/demo/package verification | CLOSE-00 | Not implemented |

An absent command assigned to the selected creation step is an expected output; the agent creates/registers/tests it. An absent prerequisite or uncertain expected effect blocks the dependent action and requires a question. No cloud operation belongs in the generic local/CI aggregate target.

## Local Python/API commands (PD-04–PD-06)

Run from the repository root on Linux/macOS with GNU Make, uv and Python `>=3.14,<3.15`. The root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` pin dependencies, Black 26.10.1 and pytest 9.1.1. Initial setup may need network access; uv commands may synchronize the ignored `.venv` and local caches. No command below provisions cloud resources or calls a database/provider.

| Purpose / creator | Invocation | Expected result / effects |
|---|---|---|
| Setup — PD-04 | `uv sync --locked` | Install locked runtime/development dependencies; uv may obtain a compatible interpreter. |
| Format — PD-04 | `make format-python` | Runs `uv run --locked black .`; rewrites discovered Python source. Review the diff. |
| Check format — PD-04 | `make check-python-format` (also plain `make`) | Runs `uv run --locked black --check --diff .`; exit 0 when formatted, nonzero on drift/tool failure. Leaves source unchanged. |
| Start API — PD-05 | `uv run --locked uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir apps/api --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` | Foreground loopback listener; stop with Ctrl+C. |
| Health — PD-05 | `curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` | Exit 0, HTTP 200, `{"status":"ok"}`. Process liveness only. |
| All tests — PD-04/05 | `uv run --locked pytest -q -W error` | Collect API and shared fixture tests; warnings fail the run. |
| API tests — PD-05 | `uv run --locked pytest apps/api/tests -q -W error` | API/configuration and shared-core checks. |

For setup/start failures, inspect the dependency, import, configuration or occupied-port error. If choosing another local port, update both start and health invocations. For formatting drift, run the formatter, review changes and rerun the check. Locked commands do not rewrite an outdated lockfile; resolve dependency/configuration errors before retrying.

Tests use synthetic data, in-memory ASGI requests, temporary files and bounded local subprocesses; they may write local caches and restore changed environment/logger settings. They need no external services or credentials. Pytest exit 0 means collected tests passed; exit 1 means failure; exit 5 (no tests) is not a pass. Investigate failures. Root pytest configuration supplies import paths; TestClient uses pinned development-only httpx2.

Settings, request IDs, JSON logging and production provider guards are documented in the [API guide](../../apps/api/README.md) and [core guide](../../apps/api/app/core/README.md). No dotenv file is loaded automatically. Python lint/type tooling, CI wiring and combined lifecycle/test Make targets remain future PD-12/13 outputs. Tool choices: [test tooling decision](../decisions/python-test-tooling.md); verification evidence: [work log](../status/work-log.md).

## Focused core/fixture checks (PD-06/PD-10)

These subsets use the same prerequisites, effects and exit rules above; the full test command includes all of them.

| Coverage / creator | Invocation |
|---|---|
| Shared conventions — PD-06 | `uv run --locked pytest apps/api/tests/core -q -W error` |
| Security boundaries — PD-06 | `uv run --locked pytest apps/api/tests/core/test_security_boundaries.py -q -W error` |
| Shared fixtures and API usage — PD-10 | `uv run --locked pytest tests/fixtures/core apps/api/tests/core/test_shared_fixtures.py -q -W error` |
| Fixture library/scripted providers — PD-10 | `uv run --locked pytest tests/fixtures/core -q -W error` |
| Production provider matrix — PD-10 | `uv run --locked pytest apps/api/tests/core/test_provider_settings.py apps/api/tests/core/test_security_boundaries.py -q -W error` |
| Retry/duplicate/concurrency/failure/validation scenarios — PD-10 | `uv run --locked pytest apps/api/tests/core/test_shared_scenarios.py -q -W error` |
| Redacted diagnostics — PD-10 | `uv run --locked pytest tests/fixtures/core/test_privacy.py -q -W error` |

Security checks include request-ID spoofing and credential-free entry-point children (10-second timeout). Production rejects fake identity/email/storage selections and development auth; empty/unsupported provider selections fail. Safe configurations supply positive controls. Test-only scripts follow the [reviewed adapter interfaces](../../tests/fixtures/core/adapter-interfaces.md); domain retry/deduplication/transaction and OTP behavior remain with their owning contracts.

The privacy check launches a credential-free pytest child (15-second timeout) that intentionally fails; the parent passes only when the failure report is correctly redacted. See [fixture usage and snapshot limits](../../tests/fixtures/core/README.md). Fixtures do not establish real provider/domain integration or cloud/NFR acceptance.

## Workstation and future commands

One-time clone/agent setup belongs in the [workstation guide](wsl-and-first-session.md). Future command owners must register explicit targets and effects above; production must reject unsafe fakes. No cloud operation belongs in the generic local/CI aggregate target.
